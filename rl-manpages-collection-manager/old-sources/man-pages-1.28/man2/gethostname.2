.TH GETHOSTNAME 2 "22 July 1995" "Linux 1.3.6" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
gethostname, sethostname \- get/set host name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int gethostname(char *" name ", size_t " len );
.br
.BI "int sethostname(const char *" name ", size_t " len );
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are used to access or to change the host name of the
current processor.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I len
is negative or, for
.BR sethostname ,
.I len
is larger than the maximum allowed size,
or, for
.BR gethostname
on Linux/i386,
.I len
is smaller than the actual size.
.TP
.B EPERM
For
.BR sethostname ,
the caller was not the superuser.
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I name
is an invalid address.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVr4, 4.4BSD  (this function first appeared in 4.2BSD).
POSIX.1 does not define these functions, but ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990 mentions
them in B.4.4.1.  
.SH BUGS
Some other implementations of
.B gethostname
successfully return
.I len
bytes even if
.I name
is longer.
Linux/Alpha complies with this behaviour.
Linux/i386, however, returns
.B EINVAL
in this case (as of DLL 4.6.27 libraries).
.SH NOTES
Under Linux/Alpha,
.B gethostname
is a system call.
Under Linux/i386,
.B gethostname
is implemented at the library level by calling
.BR uname (2).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR getdomainname (2),
.BR setdomainname (2),
.BR uname (2)
